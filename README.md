## UV-Vis Data Processor and Plotter

With this short script you will be able to take manual measurements
and merge their values into a single _.csv_ ("comma-separated values") file

This eliminates the need (and the _urge_) of using the VisionLite software (for now ¬¬)

# **Dependencies**

https://github.com/DrosteEffect/BrewerMap

# **To use:**

1. Open Octave and select your browsing directory to the source files container (folder UV-Vis-Data-Reader)
2. Run the file `uv-vis-loader.m` and follow the instructions
3. Data can be plotted using different color schemes taken from the color theory from [Cynthia Brewer](http://colorbrewer.org)
4. Merged data will be saved in _.csv_ format
